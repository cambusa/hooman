# Hooman v1.3 <img align="right" height="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cambusa/hooman/master/hooman04.png">


__Specification for a new human-writable metalanguage - Â© 2021 Rodolfo Calzetti__

It's an alternative to XML, JSON and YAML if the document is to be written by a human.

Notable features:
1. Indentation is significant (like Python)
2. Files and contents can be included
3. You can define a syntax structure and rules on values
4. It doesn't require any escaping
5. Structure and values can be overwritten (except for syntactic ones)

## The thirteen rules

```Spaces and tabs after a variable```: simple assignement

```New line + Indentation```: complex assignement

```<<   >>```: multiline text

```<<TAG  ...  TAG>>  ```: open/close mode

```***```: remark

```<--```: file include 

```@```: reset branch

```+```: increment by one (of a sibling key)

```!```: mandatory in the syntactic structure 

```*```: wildcard in the syntactic structure (for numerical/associative index)

```...```: recursive branch in the syntactic structure (for recursion) 

```==>```: entail in the syntactic rules 

```hooman/syntax/structure/.../variable defaultValue```: default value in the syntactic structure
